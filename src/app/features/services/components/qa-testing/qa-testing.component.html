                    Cylsys Software, with its International delivery model, provides
                    superior advantage to its customers. This delivery model allows
                    you to focus on your core competencies; while we manage the
                    technology operations with the help of an international team.
                    Our framework helps optimize the project cost and minimize the
                    accompanying risk as against the traditional delivery models,
                    irrespective of the project size and location.
