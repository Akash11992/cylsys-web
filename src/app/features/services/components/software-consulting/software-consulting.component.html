                      Software developers- these are the people that develop
                      applications that permit people to perform various tasks on a
                      computer or any other device. They are the creative minds
                      behind computer programming. Besides, there are other
                      developers who work for underlying systems that run the

                      Software Consultant- is not an employee. He/She is brought in
                      to provide advice (consultancy) as to how the application
                      should be implemented using current industry approaches. Often
                      the consultant provides technical advice on how to configure a
                      large application (SAP, Oracle etc.). Consultants may or may
                      not be programmers. This field is more about marketing
                      yourself. Consultants often multitask and handle more than one
                      project at a time. A consultant is often tasked with leading
                      an initiative rather than waiting for specific direction. For
                      example, instead of waiting to be asked what the status of a
                      task is or what tasks are outstanding, the consultant provides
                      a list of tasks, the status, and a schedule. Instead of doing
                      just what the client requests, a consultant looks for other
                      opportunities for improvement while doing the expected work.

                      Software contractor- These people focus on a single type of
                      mid-level activityâ€”such as programming in a specific language
                      or with a specific tool. Contractors focus on a limited scope.
                      They work on specific tasks at the direction of others and
                      often are unaware of the scope, business goals, or impact of
                      the overall project. Contractors generally fill a void in the
                      skill sets of their clients or provide additional resources
                      for accomplishing a goal.

                      An engagement process with Cylsys Software usually follows
                      these steps: Exploratory discussion to identify areas of need,
                      and determine if there is a mutually beneficial relationship.
                      Technical discussionâ€“ Sometimes, this is paired with the
                      exploratory discussion. This is where we get into the
                      technical details of what you have and what you are looking
                      for. Qualification callâ€“ This is where we identify all the
                      resources that you may need for your project. Prior to this
                      call, we may provide you with resumes for consideration.
                      Documentationâ€“This is the final step before engagement, where
                      we document the relationship by completing a Service Agreement
                      (SA) for the relationship for the specific project. In these
                      document, we outline the relationship parameters, as well as
                      project, resources, costs, timeline and associated
                      dependencies.

                      We offer Skype or telephone calls service for scheduling the

                      management tool or solution, which allows them to keep an eye
                      on the project progress 24*7. During this period, the client
                      can interact with the whole team or the main resource(s)
                      depending upon the need. If the client wants us to work at
                      certain hours (i.e. outside our normal hours of operation); we
                      donâ€™t take our foot back but do it for an additional charge.

                      Well, the number of resources employed for a project depends
                      upon the complexity and scale of the project. For instance -
                      we allocate at least two developers, one tester and a
                      part-time UI/UX Designer for a small scale project. Apart from
                      that, each project will employ a Business Analyst, Technical
                      Architect, and Project Manager.
